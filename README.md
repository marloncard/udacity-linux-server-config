## PROJECT: Linux Server Configuration
Marlon Card

## Description
For this project we are to configure & secure a linux server and use it to deploy our previously completed [catalog application](https://github.com/marloncard/udacity-item-catalog). The Udacity recommended provider was [Amazon Lightsail](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/).

## Get Server
I used the recommended [Amazon Lightsail](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/) which provides 1 month free as of this writing. The lowest tier linux plan was sufficient for the project.
* Once you've signed up the first step is to create an instance.
* I used the OS only blueprint with Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
